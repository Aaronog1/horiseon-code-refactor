# horiseon-code-refactor

## Motivation
- My motivation for this project was to improve my web development skills and gain a deeper understanding of HTML semantics. I wanted to create a web page that not only looked good but also followed best practices in web development.

## Project Goals
- I built this project to:
  - Gain hands-on experience with HTML semantic elements.
  - Create a well-structured and accessible web page.
  - Apply the principles of clean and organized CSS.
  - Learn how to use HTML semantics effectively to improve SEO and accessibility.

## Problem Solved
- The problem I aimed to solve with this project was the lack of proper HTML semantics in the initial code. Many web pages overlook the use of semantic elements, which can lead to poor accessibility and SEO rankings. By incorporating HTML semantic elements, I addressed these issues and improved the overall quality of the web page.

## What I Learned
- Throughout this project, I learned the importance of using HTML semantic elements for:
  - Structuring web content in a meaningful way.
  - Improving accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities.
  - Enhancing search engine optimization (SEO) and discoverability.
- I also gained valuable experience in:
  - Cleaning up and organizing CSS code for better readability.
  - Adding comments to the CSS file for documentation and future maintenance.
- This project taught me that utilizing HTML semantics not only improves the user experience but also sets a strong foundation for future web development endeavors.

Feel free to explore the code and use this project as a reference to improve your own web development skills. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
